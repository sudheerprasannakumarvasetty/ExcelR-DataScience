## Coding Exercises

### ðŸ”¹ Exercise 1: Prime Numbers
- **Objective:** Check whether a given number is prime.
- **Logic:**
  - A number greater than 1 is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
  - Used loop and modulus operator to determine primality.

### ðŸ”¹ Exercise 2: Product of Random Numbers
- **Objective:** Generate two random numbers, prompt user to enter their product, and validate the response.
- **Logic:**
  - Used `random.randint()` to generate values.
  - Used `input()` to get user response and compared with actual product.

### ðŸ”¹ Exercise 3: Squares of Even/Odd Numbers
- **Objective:** Print squares of all **even numbers** between 100 and 200.
- **Logic:**
  - Used a loop with a step of 2 starting from 100.
  - Calculated square using exponentiation operator.

### ðŸ”¹ Exercise 4: Word Counter
- **Objective:** Count frequency of each word in a given string.
- **Logic:**
  - Used `split()` to tokenize input.
  - Employed a dictionary to count occurrences.

### ðŸ”¹ Exercise 5: Palindrome Checker
- **Objective:** Define a function to check if input string is a palindrome.
- **Logic:**
  - Ignored case, spaces, and punctuation.
  - Compared cleaned string to its reverse.
