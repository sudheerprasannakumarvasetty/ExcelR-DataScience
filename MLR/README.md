## Tasks Performed

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Summarized dataset with statistical descriptions
- Visualized relationships using:
  - Pairplots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Boxplots and histograms
- Encoded categorical features
- Handled missing or inconsistent values (if any)

### 2. Data Splitting

- Split dataset into **80% training** and **20% testing**
- Used `train_test_split` from `sklearn`

### 3. Model Building

Built and compared **3 different regression models**:
- **Model 1**: Full model using all variables
- **Model 2**: Reduced model after removing less significant variables
- **Model 3**: Model with transformed variables and interaction terms

Interpreted model coefficients and their influence on price.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Evaluated using:
  - RÂ² (coefficient of determination)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Performed residual analysis and multicollinearity checks

### 5. Regularization Techniques

- Applied **Lasso** and **Ridge Regression**
- Compared results with baseline models
- Selected optimal alpha using cross-validation

## Interview Questions

### ðŸ”¹ What is Normalization & Standardization?

- **Normalization** scales data to a range [0, 1]
- **Standardization** centers data to have mean 0 and std deviation 1
- Helps ML models converge faster and interpret coefficients more effectively

### ðŸ”¹ Techniques to Address Multicollinearity:

- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**
- **Removing correlated predictors**
- **Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
- **Regularization methods like Ridge**

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates a complete end-to-end regression pipeline for predicting car prices using multiple predictors. By applying regularization and performing model diagnostics, we achieved robust insights into the factors that influence used car pricing.
